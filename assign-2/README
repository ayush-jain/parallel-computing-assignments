1) Run make to compile all files
2) 4 output files will be created 

out1 - Q1 a)
out2 - Q1 b)
out3 - Q1 c)

out4 - Q2 a) and b)

3) For executing run:

./out1 2

where 2 is the number of threads for Q1 a)

Similarly for others

./out4 2

will give insertion and lookup throughput for 2 threads

4)make clean to remove all executables
